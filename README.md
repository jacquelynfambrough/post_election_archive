* Although I still need to get update up and touch up most of my functions, I got most of it to operate. Hooray!
*

###Challenges

* Umm pretty much everything. Update is still a huge challenge for me.


###Words of Wisdom

* I guess I'll say you should sleep... because I didn't very much and it was not helpful in this process.
* Also, it's okay to cry. You might feel better after.
* A friend in need is a friend indeed. Get help if you need it! That got me through most of this project.
